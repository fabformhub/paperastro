PaperAstro is a lightweight starter template designed to help developers build clean, content‑focused websites using Astro and PaperCSS. This example post demonstrates how a typical article is structured within the template.

## Why PaperAstro exists

Many developers want a simple, minimal foundation for blogs or documentation sites without the overhead of a full design system. PaperAstro provides:

- A sketch‑inspired aesthetic powered by PaperCSS  
- A clear and minimal project structure  
- Built‑in support for MDX, RSS, and sitemaps  
- Form handling through Fabform.io  
- Fast performance enabled by Astro’s modern architecture  

## Writing content

Blog posts are stored in the `src/content/blog/` directory and use frontmatter to define metadata such as:

- `title`
- `description`
- `pubDate`
- `heroImage`

Content can be written in Markdown or MDX, depending on your needs.

## Adding images

Hero images can be added by referencing files inside the `src/assets/` directory. PaperAstro uses Astro’s built‑in image optimization to ensure images are responsive and efficient.

## Customizing the layout

You can modify the blog layout by editing:
