    PaperAstro is a lightweight Astro starter template designed for developers who want a clean,
    sketch‑inspired aesthetic without sacrificing performance or simplicity. It combines the speed
    and flexibility of Astro with the hand‑drawn visual style of PaperCSS, resulting in a unique
    foundation for blogs, documentation sites, and small web projects.
